## Problem Statement :
In Chennai, the population of traditional (Indian or Tamil-ian) food seekers and western and oriental cuisine lovers have been fairly even. It would prove beneficial to find out the population distribution in both the cases and see if this applies as a good feature to recommend a new user to an Indian or Western restaurant.

## Data Description :

Zomato Restaurant Rating from Kaggle:
[Chennai Restaurants Rating from Zomato](https://www.kaggle.com/phiitm/chennai-zomato-restaurants-data)

Chennai Segments geospatial info :
There are plenty of prominant areas and a lot of data sources that I found seem to have too much info. So, I settled with this csv I found on data.gov.in with the Segment names and latitudes and longitudes.

Further more, The Foursquare data will provide the reviews and tags for the hotels and restaurants in Chennai, which can be used to

1 - Label theses restaurants into Indian or Western etc. This requires a more in-depth analysis of the FourSquare json. 

2 - Build a base K-Means ( or any other Clustering algorithm) that would recommend a similar restaurant option to a new user.

3 - Add the feature created in step 1 to a new model and compare the accuracies.
